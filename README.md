# OOP practice

## Write a program that implements work with different types of transport: </br>car, truck, ship, plane.

<ul>
  <li>the implemented program must have inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism</li>
  <li>transport can be moved, parked, repaired and refuel</li>
  <li>since there are different types of transport, their repair will take place in different ways</li>
</ul>
